# ELECTRONIC-NOSE-AS-A-NONDESTRUCTIVE-ANALYTICAL-TOOL-TO-IDENTIFY-THE-MUSA-PARADISIACA-RIPENING-STAGE
This project develops an E-Nose system with electrochemical sensors to non-destructively monitor ethylene and methane for fruit ripeness assessment. Focusing on bananas, it compares destructive and non-destructive data to improve accuracy, reduce waste, and aid quality control.
